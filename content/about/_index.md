## Hi, I'm Richard, and welcome to my website!

### About Me

I’m in my 30s, married, and feel older than I’d like to admit. Seriously, I’m the definition of **nostalgic**—but in a good way.
I love all kinds of media, with a special place in my heart for video games and film.

I’ve been coding since I was 12, all thanks to my introduction to [Endless Online](https://endless-online.com).
Back then, the community was buzzing with people writing "auto trainers" using [SCAR](https://scar-divi.com/), a Pascal-based scripting language for macroing.
I jumped in, wrote some *terrible* scripts, and eventually leveled up my skills over time.

### Work Experience

My first programming gig came straight out of high school at a local company, where I did [ASP.NET](https://asp.net) web development for six years.
I learned **a ton** there, and though I eventually outgrew the role, I still look back fondly on that time.

Most recently, I worked at a SaaS company where I tackled a broad tech stack—PHP, Node, React, Angular, MySQL. It was also my first experience working 100% remotely,
and let me tell you, I loved it. I don’t think I could ever go back to the traditional 9-5 grind in an office.

### My Love for Rust

I first heard about Rust in the mid-2010s, but it wasn’t until I came across [Jake Taylor](https://iamferris.com/) and
his [Rustendo64](https://github.com/yupferris/rustendo64) project that I got hooked. Prior to that, I’d worked on a few half-baked
C++ projects that never went anywhere. But Rust was different—it helped me actually *finish* things.

It’s become my go-to language, and yes, I’ll admit it: I’ve definitely drunk the Kool-Aid. I just can’t get enough of it!

### Video Games Are My Jam

When it comes to video games, I’m a huge **Zelda** fan. I’ve probably sunk more hours into *Ocarina of Time* than any other game.
At one point, I even considered doing 100% speedruns, but life got in the way.

Lately, I’ve been obsessing over the incremental game [Egg, Inc.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/egg-inc/id993492744).
I’m even part of a Discord server with other dedicated chicken farmers (obsessed nerds), and we work together to complete our Co-Op missions fast and efficiently.
